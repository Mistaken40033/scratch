## User Story

AS A web developer

I WANT to have a place to access resources

SO THAT I can conveniently access information

# Ideas

Use "Google Search" for what we've learned in class from HTML/CSS/JS/JQUERY

- Click on link will take us to resources to look at for (CSS, HTML, ETC.)
- Multi Resourse links that are clickable
