## User Story

AS A web developer

I WANT to have a place to access resources

SO THAT I can conveniently access information
=======
- Austin - API
- TJ - Data Flow
- Ethan - Helper Everywhere "Will Solve it all"

# Ideas

Use "Google Search" for what we've learned in class from HTML/CSS/JS/JQUERY

- Click on link will take us to resources to look at for (CSS, HTML, ETC.)
- Multi Resourse links that are clickable

- Editing our website ![alt text](image.png)

- Adding Dark/Light toggle ![alt text](image-1.png)
