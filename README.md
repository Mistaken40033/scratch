## User Story

AS A web developer

I WANT to have a place to access resources

SO THAT I can conveniently access information

=======


# Ideas

Use "Google Search" for what we've learned in class from HTML/CSS/JS/JQUERY

- Click on link will take us to resources to look at for (CSS, HTML, ETC.)
- Multi Resourse links that are clickable

- Editing our website ![alt text](Image.png)

- Adding Dark/Light toggle ![alt text](image-1.png)

- Create cards for each individual's repos ![alt text](Repo-cards.png)

- Add another landing page for deeper searches on google ![alt text](Google-search.png)

- Be able to pull up any repo from our Github accounts
